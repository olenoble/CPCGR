			<p class="review">Get on a 500cc motorbike and race against five other riders on twelve circuits
around the world in the championship. Of course, there are also options to take
part in a single race or some training. The game is full of options, with three
difficulty levels and the ability to save and load your championship position.
You can even choose the colour of your bike. Two players can take part in a race
simultaneously, which is great fun. Despite all of these options, the game
retains an arcade feel to it, as opposed to being a realistic simulation of
motorbike racing. The presentation and graphics are both excellent and there is
a real sense of speed as you zoom around the tracks at well over 200mph.

			<p class="review">Not <em class="underline">this</em>! The tracks in this game are viewed from above, and you have to
buzz your 'car' (which looks exactly like a box, by the way) around the track
within the time limit to go to the next one. The trouble is that your car is
impossible to control and the track must have black ice all over it, making it
ridiculously difficult to progress &ndash; well, that's what I think. The pictures of
the McLaren and Ferrari at the top are nice, but the rest of the graphics aren't
as good. The tune and digitised speech ("three... two... one... go!") are both
superb, though, but that doesn't make the game any better for it.

			<p class="review">Time to go racing once again as you try to complete three laps of each track
(nine of them in total) before your time runs out. The time you get for each
track depends on how well you did on the previous one, so it's important to do
as well as you can on all the tracks. The main differences between this game and
the original are that up to three players can take part, and that the graphics
are in four-colour mode &ndash; and they're much better for it! The cars are still a
bit tricky to control, but if you keep practising, you will get somewhere.

			</div>
			<p class="review">Gonch's Walkman has been confiscated again, and if his mum finds out, he will be
in <em class="underline">big</em> trouble. Along with his friend Hollo, he decides to break into
Grange Hill and retrieve it. This is an arcade adventure in which you wander
around, looking for objects and finding what they are used for and where to use
them. The program uses menus in order to accomplish commands, and you can also
enter commands directly when you want to use objects or talk to people, although
the parser is very limited indeed. The music is really groovy (although
unfortunately it's not the old <i>Grange Hill</i> theme tune). On the other
hand, the parser and the plethora of hazards which end the game instantly make
the game frustrating to play, and the graphics are fairly poor as well.

				<p class="publisher">(Ocean, 1986)</p>
			</div>
			<p class="review">The year is 1942, and you are a prisoner of war, incarcerated in a German camp.
How will you escape? Guards patrol the camp day and night, but by watching their
movements and becoming familiar with the daily routine, and exploring the layout
of the camp, you can work out how to minimise your chances of being detected &ndash;
and if you are caught, you'll be placed in solitary confinement for a while, and
any objects you are carrying will be confiscated. This game is regarded as a
classic, but the CPC version is unfortunately a Spectrum port, and it suffers
accordingly. The concept is original, but the isometric graphics are displayed
in a single colour, and the scrolling is very slow indeed. As a result, it takes
ages to move from one place to another, and I reckon that the majority of
players will not have the patience to play it fully.

			<p class="review">Giana and Maria are dreaming, and in their dream, they enter a world full of
platforms and cute monsters which they can kill by bouncing on their heads.
Some of the platforms also reveal coins if you hit them with your head. There
are also diamonds to collect, but make sure you don't fall off the platforms!
Yes, I know what you're thinking. "This is <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>!" It is
very similar indeed; in fact, it's so similar that Nintendo sued Rainbow Arts
and won, and the game was withdrawn from the shelves after about two weeks, so
I suppose it's quite a rare game. The gameplay is as good as its Nintendo
equivalent, although the movement is slow and there are no sound effects at all!

				<p class="reviewer">Reviewed by John Beckett</p>
			</div>
			<p class="review">An early game by programming great David Perry, <i>Great Gurianos</i> is a port
of the arcade game <i>Gladiator</i>. You play as Gurianos and must walk along,
using your sword and shield to either block or destroy incoming monsters, before
taking on a selection of rival gladiators. There are a few nice touches: you can
block and strike at three different levels &ndash; low, mid and high &ndash; adding a bit of
strategy to the boss battles; armour disappears from you and your opponents as
you battle; and there is an excellent tune on the title screen. However, the
game is criminally difficult, and the graphics are rather bland and empty. The
big killer, though, is that due to lack of space to include an ending, Perry
made the final boss invincible!

			</div>
			<p class="review">This game appeared on one of Alternative's <i>Classic Arcadia</i> compilations;
as far as I know, it wasn't released on its own. Anyway, you have to guide some
frogs safely across a busy road and a river, and place them in boxes on the
other side of the river; yes, it's a <i>Frogger</i> clone. You have to manoeuvre
the frogs through the gaps in the fast-moving traffic, and then leap across the
logs on the river, and time the leaps into the boxes perfectly, otherwise you
lose a life and must start the process again. When you have placed five frogs in
the boxes, you go to the next level. The graphics are fairly good, and the sound
effects are simple, but the second level is too difficult and it's not a game
you'll stick with for long.

			<p class="review">Take on the might of the enemy's forces to rescue the captives in this Cold War
platformer. Run, jump and shoot your way past their troops to reach your goal.
Any collisions means instant death so it turns out to be quite a job &ndash;
especially when some of your opponents are armed with guns while you are only
armed with your trusty combat knife. Luckily, if you manage to bump off a
passing handyman you can pick up new weapon, albeit with limited ammunition,
such as a flamethrower or a bazooka, which prove to be considerably useful in a
sticky situation. A nice looking game with limited sound, it remains difficult
but ultimately frustating.

			<p class="review">Gregory has gone to sleep, but a ghost has come along and taken his alarm clock!
He now has to enter his dreams and find the four pieces of the clock before he
wakes up again. The first level is set in a warehouse of some sort, and then
it's on to a jungle full of strange inhabitants, an art gallery, and finally a
battlefield. It's a game which is aimed at younger people and this is clear from
the blocky but bright graphics, but there's not much sound, and it's not very
good, anyway. The first level is OK but the second level will have you tearing
your hair out.
